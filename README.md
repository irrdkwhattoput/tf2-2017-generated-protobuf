# Generated Protobufs for TF2 2017 Leak

Pre-built TF2 `pb.cc` and `pb.h` files from the .proto projects, so you dont have to compile by yourself.

to use this, simply include the `generated_proto` and the google protobuf source files directory in the compiler args.

DO NOT edit these files!!! if you want to modify it, go make your changes in the original .proto project files and then rebuild!
